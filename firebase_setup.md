# Firebase Quick Steps
1. In Firebase Console, create a new project.
2. Enable Authentication -> Email/Password.
3. Create a Firestore database (start in test mode for now, then tighten rules).
4. Get your Web SDK config and paste into `firebase/clientApp.js` or set environment variables in Netlify.
5. Deploy rules from the console or Firebase CLI.
